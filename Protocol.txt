				   0. Preface

   This document describes the TWDC (Tumbleweed Developer Contest) protocol and
is targeted mainly for developer audience.

				 1. Description

   The TWDC protocol is generally a file transfer protocol. Currently it
supports only sending of file from client to server, but it is designed so
it can be easily expanded and new functions added.
   The protocol is binary protocol. All data is send in binary format even
control messages. The first byte of the message gives its type and hints the
processing of the message.
   TODO: Decide whether the protocol will be synchronous or asynchronous.

				  2. Messages

   Each message of the protocol consists of header and body. The header gives
service information such as message type and protocol version. The body
contains only data in different formats depending of the message type.

   There are three types of messages:
    * error message: it gives the status of the last operation
    * file message: with this message the client request file transfer to
                    the server
    * data message: this message is used for data transfers. All the data
                    is _compressed_.
