Description
---

Your task is to design and implement an algorithm for transferring data over
the internet which makes optimal usage of CPU resources and network bandwidth.
The idea is to transfer a file over the internet and to compress it in order
to achieve optimal resource usage. The goal is not to write a compression
algorithm but to come up with an algorithm which reads and compress data in a
clever way to use the capabilities of the network.

Deliverable
---

   * Well commented source code in C, C++ or Java
   * Detailed documentation describing the algorithm and the modules of your
     program

You will need to provide a client (which sends file) and a server which saves
the received file.

Client:
   * Input: filename, hostname server, port server
   * Output: filename size, duration of the transfer, Mb/s, [compression rate optional]

Server:
   * each time a client connects: filename, size, client ip, Mb/sec.

Third Party Libraries
---

All participants are required to rely on the zlib library. It can be
downloaded from http://www.gzip.org/zlib/. There is also a java version at
http://www.jcraft.com/jzlib/

Limitations
---

You are not allowed to use any other third party libraries. Your code must be
original and not similar to existing P2P technologies.
